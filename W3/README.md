# Python - Comments, Variables, and Data-types
## Python - made easy for Data Analyst

Getting started with Python for Data analysis can be quite daunting from the regular stuff done on spreadsheets. Whether you use Google, Excel, or any other spreadsheet package for your analysis, learning Python is a plus you need to upskill and gain leverage in the ever-competitive market that is the tech ecosystem.

Here are some fundamental concepts you need to grasp to fully ground you in your journey to becoming a great analyst using Python for analysis:

  1 **Making Comment:**

Imagine you're writing a Python program as if it were a recipe in a cookbook. The code is the series of instructions to prepare a dish, and the comments are the notes you write in the margins.

1. **Code (Recipe):**
   - Your Python code is like the list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions to cook a meal. It provides the necessary information for the computer (or the chef) to understand and execute the task.

2. **Comments (Notes in the Margins):**
   - Comments in Python are like the notes you write in the margins of a cookbook. They don't affect the final dish (output of the program), but they provide valuable information for anyone reading the recipe (code).

   - If you write a note next to a specific step in your recipe, it could explain why you're doing it that way or offer alternatives. Similarly, Python comments explain why a certain line of code is there, the purpose of a function, or any other relevant details.

   - Just as someone reading the recipe might appreciate additional information on techniques or ingredient substitutions, someone reading your code (including your future self) will benefit from well-written comments that explain the reasoning behind the code.

   - Comments are like leaving breadcrumbs for others (or yourself) to understand the logic, purpose, or any tricky parts of the code. They make it easier for someone else to pick up your recipe (code) and understand it without having to decipher every step.

By thinking of Python comments as notes in a cookbook, you emphasize their role in enhancing the understandability of your code, fostering collaboration, and ensuring that the recipe is clear for others (or future you) to follow.
