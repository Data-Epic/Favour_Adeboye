# Python - Comments, Variables, and Data-types
## Python - made easy for Data Analyst

Getting started with Python for Data analysis can be quite daunting from the regular stuff done on spreadsheets. Whether you use Google, Excel, or any other spreadsheet package for your analysis, learning Python is a plus you need to upskill and gain leverage in the ever-competitive market that is the tech ecosystem.

Here are some fundamental concepts you need to grasp to fully ground you in your journey to becoming a great analyst using Python for analysis:

  1 **Making Comment:**

Imagine you're writing a recipe to cook Jollof rice in a cookbook. you write down a series of steps to follow to prepare the dish, you also include notes within the recipe to give additional information or clarification about the instructions written. These notes help anyone reading the cookbook to understand the steps in the recipe and how it works to help them prepare the dish.

Your Python code is like the list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions to cook a meal. It provides the necessary information for the computer (or the chef) to understand and execute the task.
Comments in Python are like the notes you write in the margins of a cookbook. They don't affect the final dish (output of the program), but they provide valuable information for anyone reading the recipe (code).

Comments in Python can be written before the line of code it is explaining or in line, but it must always start with '#'. This prevents Python from executing it. If you want to write multiple-line comments then enclose them like this:

      ''' This is a 
          multiple-line
          comment '''
          
If you write a note next to a specific step in your recipe, it could explain why you're doing it that way or offer alternatives. Similarly, Python comments explain why a certain line of code is there, the purpose of a function, or any other relevant details.

Just as someone reading the recipe might appreciate additional information on techniques or ingredient substitutions, someone reading your code (including your future self) will benefit from well-written comments that explain the reasoning behind the code.
